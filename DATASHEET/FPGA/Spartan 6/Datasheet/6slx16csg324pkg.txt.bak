<!-- With Internet Explorer 5.X, if "Show friendly HTTP error messages" is checked (by default), the client intercepts error messages such as the 404 that will be generated by this page.  Instead of displaying the message or action sent by the server, IE5 will display its own page.  With 404 Not Found errors this behavior seems to depend on the length of the page the server returns.  If the page is long enough, IE5 will assume you know what you are doing and display the page.  These comments are here to make the page long enough for IE5 to display. -->
