WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net c3_control0<13> is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal

   edfifo/rd_fifo/Mram_mem2_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does not drive
   any load pins in the design.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.
DRC detected 0 errors and 9 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
